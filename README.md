# Langchain Chatbot

This is an AI-powered chatbot built using **Langchain** and **Streamlit** that processes PDF documents and provides conversational retrieval-based responses. It leverages OpenAI's GPT model for generating intelligent responses based on uploaded documents.

## Features
- Upload and process **PDF documents**.
- Conversational retrieval using **Langchain**.
- Memory-based chat history management.
- Interactive **Streamlit** UI.

## Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Usage
Run the chatbot using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### How It Works
1. Upload a **PDF document** via the sidebar.
2. The chatbot processes the document and stores embeddings for retrieval.
3. Ask **questions** related to the uploaded document.
4. Get responses generated by OpenAI's model with contextual understanding.
